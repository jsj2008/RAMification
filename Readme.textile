A Tool to manage RAM disks.

h2. ATTENTION

This is a small pet project and in no way finished. I'm working on it on a very irregular basis and the current code if far from complete.

h2. Features

Not all Features are implemented yet.

h3. Core Freatures

* create, mount and unmount a default RAM disk
* optionally disable Unified Media Buffer on RAM disks to reduce memory footprint
* autolaunch on login

h3. Favourite Management

* create, mount and unmount favourites
* manage favourites (volume name, size, backup mode, automount on launch)
* automount favourites 
* autosync favourites (backup on unmount, restore on mount, etc. )
* (If necessary) prevent unmounting of RAM disks without backups
* rename mounted favourites if user renames the volume in the finder
* use custom icons for ramdisk

h2. Disclaimer

The tool is in heavy development and may very well not work at all or break things on your machine. Use at your own risk.
