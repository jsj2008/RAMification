h1. RAMification

A Tool to manage RAM disks.

h2. ATTENTION

This is a small pet project and in no way finished. I'm working on it on a very irregular basis and the current code if far from complete.

h2. Features

The list of planned features includes:

* Create, Mount and Unmount a default RAM disks
* Create, Mount and Unmount favourites
** Manage favourites (Name, Size, Synchronize, Automount)
** Automount favourites 
** Autosync favourites (Backup on unmount, Restore on mount, etc. )

h2. Feature Considerations

* Can the user change the name of a mounted disk?
** Directly change the Disk name (in the Finder or elsewhere)
** Indirectly change the Name in the Favourites manger
** Mirror the changes to the disk and the favourite?
* Can the user change the size of a mounted disk?
** Backup, Remount and Restore the disk with the new size?
* Display the last Backup of a RAM disk?
* Display the backup activity of a RAM in the Menu? In the Settings?
* Warn the user if hibernate is set to store to HD which leads to unmounted RAM disks after wake up?

h2. Disclaimer

The tool is in heavy development and may very well not work at all or break things on your machine. Use at your own risk.
